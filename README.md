# Gallows Game

This is a simple implementation of the Gallows Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game randomly selects a word from a list of words and the player has to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time. If the player guesses a letter that is in the word, the letter is revealed. If the player guesses a letter that is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn. If the hangman is completely drawn before the word is guessed, the player loses. If the word is guessed before the hangman is completely drawn, the player wins.

This repository is intended to be used for testing **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
